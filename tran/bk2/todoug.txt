Doug,

If I don't bother you I would like, as long as I'm going on with the translation, to signal you some typos in your articles:
http://www.doughellmann.com/PyMOTW/StringIO/index.html -  conctatenation
http://www.doughellmann.com/PyMOTW/string/index.html - INTERPLOATION

Regarding this article: http://www.doughellmann.com/PyMOTW/struct/index.html at a certain point you say:
"... (note the discrepancy in the floating point value)."
but no console output is shown in the article.
So I took the liberty to add in my translated article some console output for the pack and unpack example to clarify the discrepancy concept.

I'm well aware that a translator must stick to the original article without whatsoever interpretation so if you don'agree I will cut out from the article the console output.

Sorry again to bother you.

Bye, Roberto
